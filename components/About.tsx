        <p>
          I'm a fourth year student at the University of Toronto studying
          computer science, specializing in machine learning and data science.
          My interests are in finance and hope to eventually create something
          huge in the fin-tech world.

          Learning is a very big part of my life. It motivates me to be the best
          version of myself and allows me to to reach my goals. After
          university, I plan on getting certified with a CFA while and
          eventually getting my MBA.

          Aside from the random formulas floating around in my brain, I enjoy
          playing basketball and training Muay Thai. I'm addicted to winning and
          will take any loss to heart. Losing makes me want to win even more;
          the competition fuels me.

          My fundamental belief is that anyone can do anything no matter how
          much talent you start with. As corny as it is, the only thing stopping
          me from achieving my goals is me.
